Such analysis could help public health stakeholder to design/optimize initiatives to address issues resulting in vision impairment, enhance access to eye care services and utilization of resources to target populations.\n",

Furthermore, private healthcare establishments could capitalize on the insights to sell individual or new solutions that address previously unmet needs in eye care, thus applying this study in enriching public and private initiatives."
